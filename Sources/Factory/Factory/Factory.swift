// MARK: - Factory

/// A Factory manages the dependency injection process for a specific object or service.
///
/// It's used to produce an object of the desired type when required. This may be a brand new instance or Factory may
/// return a previously cached value from the specified scope.
///
/// ## Defining a Factory
/// Let's define a Factory that returns an instance of `ServiceType`. To do that we need to extend a Factory `Container` and within
/// that container we define a new computed variable of type `Factory<ServiceType>`. The type must be explicitly defined, and is usually a
/// protocol to which the returned dependency conforms.
/// ```swift
/// extension Container {
///     var service: Factory<ServiceType> {
///         Factory(self) { MyService() }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Inside the computed variable we define our Factory, passing it a reference to the enclosing container. We also provide it with
/// a closure that creates an instance of our dependency when required. That Factory is then returned to the caller, usually to be evaluated
/// (see `callAsFunction()` below). Every time we resolve this factory we'll get a new, unique instance of our object.
///
/// Factory also provides a bit of syntactic sugar that lets us do the same thing in a more convenient form,
/// ```swift
/// extension Container {
///     var service: Factory<ServiceType> {
///         self { MyService() }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Transient
/// If you're concerned about building Factory's on the fly, don't be. Like SwiftUI Views, Factory structs and modifiers
/// are lightweight and transitory. They're created when needed and then immediately discarded once their purpose has
/// been served.
///
/// Other operations exist for Factory. See ``FactoryModifying``.
public struct Factory<T>: FactoryModifying {

    /// Public initializer creates a Factory capable of managing dependencies of the desired type.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - container: The bound container that manages registrations and scope caching for this Factory. The scope helper functions bind the
    ///   current container as well defining the scope.

    /// Evaluates the factory and returns an object or service of the desired type. The resolved instance may be brand new or Factory may
    /// return a cached value from the specified scope.
    ///
    /// To resolve the Factory  one simply calls the Factory as a function. Here we use the `shared` container that's provided for each
    /// and every container type.
    /// ```swift
    /// let service = Container.shared.service()
    /// ```
    /// The resolved instance may be brand new or Factory may return a cached value from the specified ``Scope``.
    ///
    /// If you're passing an instance of a container around to your views or view models, just call it directly.
    /// ```swift
    /// let service = container.service()
    /// ```
    /// Finally, you can also use the @Injected property wrapper and specify a keyPaths to the desired dependency.
    /// ```swift
    /// @Injected(\.service) var service: ServiceType
    /// ```
    /// Unless otherwise specified, the @Injected property wrapper looks for dependencies in the standard shared container provided by Factory,
    /// so the above example is functionally identical to the `Container.shared.service()` example shown earlier. Here's one pointing to
    /// your own container.
    /// ```swift
    /// @Injected(\MyCustomContainer.service) var service: ServiceType
    /// ```
    /// - Returns: An object or service of the desired type.

    ///
    /// This factory overrides the original factory closure and clears the associated scope so that the next time this factory is resolved
    /// Factory will evaluate the new closure and return an instance of the newly registered object instead.
    ///
    /// Here's an example of registering a new Factory closure.

    /// container.service.register {
    ///     SomeService()

    /// used to provide mocks and testing doubles.
    ///

    /// will all of its registrations.
    ///
    /// The original factory closure is preserved, and may be restored by resetting the Factory to its original state.

    ///  - factory: A new factory closure that produces an object of the desired type when needed.

// MARK: - ParameterFactory

/// Factory capable of taking parameters at runtime
///
/// Like it or not, some services require one or more parameters to be passed to them in order to be initialized correctly. In that case use `ParameterFactory`.
///
/// We define a ParameterFactory exactly as we do a normal factory with two exceptions: we need to specify the
/// parameter type, and we need to consume the passed parameter in our factory closure.
/// ```swift
/// extension Container {
///     var parameterService: ParameterFactory<Int, MyServiceType> {
///        self { ParameterService(value: $0) }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Resolving it is straightforward. Just pass the parameter to the Factory.
/// ```Swift
/// let myService = Container.shared.parameterService(n)
/// ```
/// One caveat is that you can't use the `@Injected` property wrapper with `ParameterFactory` as there's no way to get
/// the needed parameters to the property wrapper before the wrapper is initialized. That being the case, you'll
/// probably need to reference the container directly and do something similar to the following.
///  ```swift
///  class MyClass {
///      var myService: MyServiceType
///      init(_ n: Int) {
///          myService = Container.shared.parameterService(n)
///      }
///  }
/// ```
/// If you need to pass more than one parameter just use a tuple, dictionary, or struct.
/// ```swift
/// var tupleService: ParameterFactory<(Int, Int), MultipleParameterService> {
///     self { (a, b) in
///         MultipleParameterService(a: a, b: b)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Finally, if you define a scope keep in mind that the first argument passed will be used to create the dependency
/// and *that* dependency will be cached. Since the cached object will be returned from now on any arguments passed in
/// later requests will be ignored until the factory or scope is reset.
