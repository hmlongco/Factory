///
/// If you use a custom container, you have to create your own trait that conforms to the `TestTrait` protocol.
///
/// That said, it's also possible to leverage this behavior in `XCTestCase`, by using the `@TaskLocal` provided `withValue` method.
/// See examples in the ``ParallelXCTests`` file.
