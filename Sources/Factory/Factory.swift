// MARK: - Factory

/// A Factory manages the dependency injection process for a specific object or service.
///
/// It's used to produce an object of the desired type when required. This may be a brand new instance or Factory may
/// return a previously cached value from the specified scope.
///
/// ## Defining a Factory
/// Let's define a Factory that returns an instance of `ServiceType`. To do that we need to extend a Factory `Container` and within
/// that container we define a new computed variable of type `Factory<ServiceType>`. The type must be explicitly defined, and is usually a
/// protocol to which the returned dependency conforms.
/// ```swift
/// extension Container {
///     var service: Factory<ServiceType> {
///         Factory(self) { MyService() }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Inside the computed variable we define our Factory, passing it a reference to the enclosing container. We also provide it with
/// a closure that creates an instance of our dependency when required. That Factory is then returned to the caller, usually to be evaluated
/// (see `callAsFunction()` below). Every time we resolve this factory we'll get a new, unique instance of our object.
///
/// Factory also provides a bit of syntactic sugar that lets us do the same thing in a more convenient form,
/// ```swift
/// extension Container {
///     var service: Factory<ServiceType> {
///         self { MyService() }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Transient
/// If you're concerned about building Factory's on the fly, don't be. Like SwiftUI Views, Factory structs and modifiers
/// are lightweight and transitory. They're created when needed and then immediately discarded once their purpose has
/// been served.
///
/// Other operations exist for Factory. See ``FactoryModifying``.

/// parameter type, and we need to consume the passed parameter in our factory closure.

///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// ```Swift
/// let myService = Container.shared.parameterService(n)
/// ```
/// One caveat is that you can't use the `@Injected` property wrapper with `ParameterFactory` as there's no way to get
/// the needed parameters to the property wrapper before the wrapper is initialized. That being the case, you'll
/// probably need to reference the container directly and do something similar to the following.
///  ```swift
///  class MyClass {
///      var myService: MyServiceType
///      init(_ n: Int) {
///          myService = Container.shared.parameterService(n)
///      }
///  }
/// ```
/// If you need to pass more than one parameter just use a tuple, dictionary, or struct.
/// ```swift
/// var tupleService: ParameterFactory<(Int, Int), MultipleParameterService> {
///     self { (a, b) in
///         MultipleParameterService(a: a, b: b)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Finally, if you define a scope keep in mind that the first argument passed will be used to create the dependency
/// and *that* dependency will be cached. Since the cached object will be returned from now on any arguments passed in
/// later requests will be ignored until the factory or scope is reset.
